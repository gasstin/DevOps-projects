**## Jenkins in Docker Container**

# Resume
In this project we practice Jenkins and Docker. We'll create a simple pipeline to
connect with GitHub.

For now, the ´server.py´ it's a simple "Helo World" build with **FastAPI**. Maybe in the future we'll improve
the server.


Jenkins will run the test, build and deploy the server.
